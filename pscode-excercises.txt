// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a = input number 1
b = input number 2

print a + b

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Integer Number, S
Input Number
S=Number%2

if (S==0)
output "Even"
else
output "Odd"
end if
stop

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Write "please enter 5 numbers"
Read n1,n2,n3,n4,n5

Write "The average is"
Set avg to (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5)/5
Write avg

If (n1 < n2)
   Set max to n2
Else
   Set max to n1
If (n3 > max)
   Set max to n3
If (n4 > max)
   Set max to n4
If (n5>max)
   Set max to n5
Write "the max is"
Write max

If (n1 > n2)
   Set min to n2
Else
   Set min to n1
If (n3 < min)
   Set min to n3
If (n4 < min)
   Set min to n4
If (n5 < min)
   Set min to n5
Write "The min is"
Write min

Results
Number set = 1,2,3,4,5
Average = (1+2+3+4+5)/5 
Average = 3
Max = 5
Min = 1
